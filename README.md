# NewPolicyCountForecasts

In this repository are the codes I've written in R Markdown to fit for smoothing parameters that are used to forecast time series data.

The data, which is public, is the new policy count time series from Citizens Property Insurance.

[npc_MMM](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bittyfuz/NewPolicyCountForecasts/blob/master/npc_MMM_demo.html) is the model which is used in the [forecast code](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bittyfuz/NewPolicyCountForecasts/blob/master/npc_MMM_forecast_demo.html).
The html outputs of the R markdown codes can be previewed by clicking on the links.

[npc_GP.ipynb](npc_GP.ipynb) is a test of fitting with the Gaussian process method.
